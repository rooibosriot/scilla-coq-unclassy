(*

I'm not sure whether the I/O automata is the right model for this
task. Perhaps, we shoudl instead rethink the model in terms of
call/receive automata, which are similar to Disel's protocols in a way
they handle message passing. The only difference is that here we don't
have consider several communicating nodes, and instead work with just
one.

Thus, only "well-formed" messages get reacted to.

Furthermore, any transition can end with zero to n send messages
(i.e., calls), which will be sent in a non-deterministic order.

This should give enough space to implement the systems of
communicating contracts.

Next, we can proceed on making assertions for composing contracts ans
build on the research from the I/O automata community.

Finally, we will have to come up with a way to represent SC automata
in a language with exceptions and cost semantics, and compile it down
to EVM.

(*************************************

Great story for compositionality: verify the "library" and then link
another contract against it and show that the joined interaction
always produces the same traces as it were only a client contract with
internal function.

This is still not equivalent to the usual execution because of limited
stack size. Thus, a call to library contract can fail, even if
everything is implemented correctly!

Wow.

Just wow.

 **************************************)

(************

Some more things to discuss or implement in the future:

* Formulate other sorts invariants for outgoing messages.

* Do we have to model the return value explicitly, or can we just
  represent it via message passing?

* How to fomulate the property that shouldn't be violated by the
  Puzzle contract from the Luu-al:CCS'16 paper?

  Perhaps, for this, we need a more "Concurrent" semantics, in which
  message sends are disparate from the corresponding contracts.

* Formalize the protocol of KoET contract and state the trace property
  that a previous king always gets correctly reimbursed. This would
  require to state properties over interactions between several
  parties.

* Start discussing a compiler from a back-end, verified with respect
  to a protocol.
